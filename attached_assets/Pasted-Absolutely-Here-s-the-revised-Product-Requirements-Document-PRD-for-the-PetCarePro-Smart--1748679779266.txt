## 🧱 Tech Stack & Style Guidelines

### Tech Stack

* **React** (via Vite)
* **Vanilla CSS**
* **React Router** for navigation
* **Static mock data** (hardcoded JSON or arrays)

### CSS Organization

* `/styles/` folder with individual `.css` files:

  * `main.css` – Global styles, reset, typography
  * `layout.css` – Grids, containers, flex utilities
  * `components/` – Buttons, cards, forms, navbars
  * `pages/` – Landing, Dashboard, etc.
* Follow **BEM naming convention** for classes (`.btn--primary`, `.card__header`)
* Use **CSS variables** for colors and spacing:

  ```css
  :root {
    --primary-color: #1b8ef2;
    --accent-color: #f2b01b;
    --font-body: 'Segoe UI', sans-serif;
    --border-radius: 8px;
  }
  ```
* Responsive layout via media queries:

  ```css
  @media (max-width: 768px) {
    .sidebar {
      display: none;
    }
  }
  ```

* No back-end logic (mock UI behavior only)
* Desktop and mobile responsive designs
* Readme with setup instructions (`vite dev`), file structure, and contribution notes

---

## ✅ Success Criteria (for Mockup)

* All core features visually represented and styled using vanilla CSS
* Responsive and accessible layout (ARIA labels, color contrast)
* No third-party CSS libraries or frameworks
* Clean, commented codebase ready for handoff to back-end or full-stack team
